Starting popeye:

Change the name of your preferred executable to py.exe
To operate it from the terminal:                py
To solve problems recorded in file XX:          py XX

Commandline parameters:
-maxmem
	You can provide for Popeye for example 40960 kilobyte (or 40 megabye)
	of memory with
		 -maxmem 40960    resp.    -maxmem 40M
	to speed up solving.

-maxtime
	Indicate the maximum number of seconds that Popeye may spend
	on each problem. This command line option is
	equivalent to the option maxtime that can be used in the problem
	definition (see below).
	Example:
		-maxtime 60
	If a problem hasn't been solved after one minute, solving
	continues with the next problem in the input file (if any).

-regression
	FOR DEVELOPERS MAINLY
	Popeye version info and solving times are suppressed from
	output files.


Stopping Popeye:

        press  CTRL + C  key combination



Description of the input language of popeye:

The input to popeye is not case sensitive. Every input to popeye starts with
the reserved word `BeginProblem'. After entering this command to popeye,
following commands may be used:

	remark, author, origin, title, protocol,
        condition, option, stipulation, sstipulation, forsyth, pieces, twin

The order of these commands is free, and can also occur more times.
The last of the commands in the second line is relevant. All of these
commands expect further parameters. Lets start with the simpler commands:

 - remark: this keyword introduces a comment. Everything up to the end of the
	line will be ignored and has no further effects.

 - author: The parameter to this command is the author of the problem. All
	Text up to end of line will be put above the diagram in the output.
	This input is completely optional and has no effect to the other
	capabilities of the program. All the input of multiple author
	commands will be placed on the output.

 - origin: All the same as the author command.
 - title:  All the same as the author command.

 - protocol: The parameter to his command is interpreted as filename, and all
	further output of popeye on the screen is also placed in the given
	file. If the file exists already, the output of popeye is appended to
	the file. The file will not be deleted.

 - condition: All the conditions neccessary for the problem, seperated by
	blanks or newline, should be given to this command. 
        Through combination of single conditions you can get other
        already existing conditions:
        for example: Circe  and  Immunchess  results in  StrictCirce

	After the conditions Imitator, MagicSquare, Hole,
	FrischaufCirce, WhitePromSquares, BlackPromSquares or one of
	the ForcedSquares, list the squares on which the imitators are
	to be placed, where the special squares are located, where
	promoted pieces (FrischaufCirce) are located, or where the
	white or black promotionsquares are located.

	The condition PromOnly must be followed by a list of piece types,
	separated through blanks. Promotion is only allowed into those
	piece types.

	The condition ChameleonCirce can be followed by a list of
	piece types, separated by blanks. The list determines how
	pieces change their type before being reborn. (Examples:
		"ChameleonCirce S B R Q S" is ordinary Chameleon-Circe
			and equivalent to "ChameleonCirce"
		"ChameleonCirce S Q R B S" gives reverse ChameleonCirce.)

	After some of the Circe, Immun, Madrasi, Phantomchess or Genevachess
	conditions you can enter "RexInclusiv".

	After all Anticirce conditions "Cheylan" or "Calvet" can be entered -
	according to the type desired; Calvet is the default.

	After the Isardam condition, "TypeB" can be entered.

	After the SingleBox condition, "Type1", "Type2" or "Type3" can
	be entered.

	After the RepublicanChess condition, "Type1" or "Type2" can
	be indicated; Type2 is the default.

	After the Sentinelles condition "PionAdvers", "PionNeutre",
	"ParaSentinelles", or "Berolina" can be entered, and also
	"MaximumWhite", "MaximumBlack" or "MaximumTotal" followed by a
	number.

	After MessignyChess, (Bi)Woozles, (Bi)Heffalumps and Protean
	Chess you can enter "RexExclusiv".

	After the WhiteOscillatingKings or BlackOscillatingKings
	condition "TypeB" or or "TypeC" can be entered.

	After GridChess, various variantes can be entered.
	VerticalShift, HorizontalShift and DiagonalShift produce the
	normal grid shifted by one rank and/or file. E.g. the cell
	containing the square a1 consists of:
		VerticalShift:		a1b1
		HorizontalShift:	a1a2
		DiagonalShift:		a1
	Orthogonal followed by a list of files (to the left of any
	grid lines) and ranks (below any grid lines) all without
	spaces between.
	Irregular followed by space-separated lists of square groups
	forming the grid cells. N.B. The largest square group can be
	omitted as all remaining squares not specified will form 
	another group. 
	For example the standard grid can be described by any of
		condition grid
		condition grid orthogonal bdf246
		condition grid irregular a8a7b8b7 c8c7d8d7 ...
	Specifying   
	   condition grid irregular
	with no squares listed will make all moves illegal.
	GridLine followed by a list of lines will add extra lines to
	the grid. This should be used only to specify partial lines that
	do not subdivide a grid cell, (i.e. to allow some moves to be
	legal within a grid cell) as specifying cells is more
	efficient. The grid lines must be specified in 4 characters e.g.
		condition grid gridline Ha24 Vc61
	will draw a horizontal grid line from the bottom-left corner of
	a2 for 4 squares and a vertical line from the bottom-left corner
	of c6 for 1 square, on top of the normal grid. 
	To draw grid lines on a blank board, i.e. with no regular grid, 
	specify
		condition grid irregular gridline Ha24 Vc61
	(N.B. In the context of grid chess, moves go as straight lines
	from square centre to square centre; pieces that do not move
	in straight lines may not behave as expected; moves are permitted
	which merely touch the end of a gridline (e.g with gridline Ve11 
	and wKd1, the move Kd1-e2 is legal).
	
	After any of the VaultingKings conditions, a space-separated
	list of piece types may be given. The checked king will move
	additionally as one of the piece types in the list. If the
	option Transmuting is given, the checked king will move only
	as one of the pieces in the list (not as king). If no piece
	type is given, the checked king (additionally) moves as
	equihopper.
	
	After the MustCapture, Maximummer and Minimummer conditions,
	the keyword "Ultra" indicates that the respective Ultra
	condition is intended.
	

 - option: Everything which should be in effect should be given here as
	blank seperated list. The following is recognized:

	Try             calculate if a move is a try.
	Defence         this option is followed by a number indicating
			the number of defences which should be taken
			into consideration. For instance Defence 1 all
			real tries are calculated.
	SetPlay         calculate setplay.
	Threat          for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when there is no threat in less or equal this
			number of moves.
	WhiteToPlay     white starts moving in helpplay.
	Variation       show threats and variations.
	MoveNumbers     Movenumber, already calculated move and cumulated
			solving time on output.
	StartMoveNumber This option is followed by the Movenumber
			popeye was interrupted at.
	NoWk            without white king
	NoBk            without black king
	Duplex          calculate stipulation for both sides
	NoThreat        calculate variations without calculating threats
	MaxSolutions    This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of solutions 
			are reached.
	MaxFlightsquares  for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when the number of flightsquares for it's king
			are more or equal this number.
	EnPassant       Must be followed by at most two squares. A possible
			enpassant-key to this square(s) is calculated.
	CastlingMutuallyExclusive <wrooksquare><brooksquare>
			Castlings with the rooks that occupy the
			indicated squares in the game array are
			mutually exclusive.
                        Example: CastlingMutuallyExclusive a1h8
                        For indicating more than one pair of mutually
                        exclusive castlings, the option can used
                        multiple times.
	NoBoard         The chessboard is not printed to screen or into file.
	NoShortVariations  Short variations are suppressed on output.
	HalfDuplex      calculate stipulation only for the opponent side.
	PostKeyPlay     The position entered is considered to be the position
			after the key. Just the solution play is analysed.
	NonTrivial m n  A special option to solve/cook/test long self and
			(semi)reflex problems. The second argument n
			deter- mines which black moves are considered
			to be trivial - a move that can be met by a
			s#n (or r=n resp.). In long problems (more
			than n moves) black has at every stage at
			least one nontrivial move. I. e. a move that
			doesnot lead to a s#n. The first argument m
			determines how many additional nontrivial
			moves can be granted to black by white during
			the whole solving procedure.  Example: nontr 0
			1. This is the most restrictive option.  White
			forced to play moves that leave black with
			only one move not met by a s#1.
	Intelligent     intelligent (quick) solving of helpmate-moremovers.
			After the intelligent option, the maximum number of 
			solutions per mating position can be given.
	MaxTime         This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of seconds  
			solving time are reached.

	NoCastling	This option must be followed by the squares of those
			pieces that cannot castle anymore in the
			diagram position.
	Quodlibet       In s# or r# also direct mates are a solution.
	StopOnShortSolutions  Calculation is terminated after detecting of
			      short solutions.
	Beep            This option can be followed by an integer. Each time
			Popeye has found a solution it beeps a number
			of times.
	SuppressGrid    (Grid Chess) Suppress the rendition of grid lines 
			in text and LaTeX output.
	WriteGrid	(Grid Chess) Writes an additional board that
			the partition of the board into grid cells.
			Useful for irregular grids.
	KeepMatingPiece	Stop solving when there is no piece left that could
			deliver mate.
	LastCapture	Follow by a colour, piece and square as in the piece
			command. Specifies piece captured on move leading to 
			the diagram.

	SEMI is valid only in combination with direct reflex-play.

   All these stipulations must be followed by a number giving the
   count of moves.

 - sstipulation: The stipulation can also be indicated in "structured form".
	This form allows all stipulations to be indicated that can also be
	indicated in traditional form using the command "stipulation". In
	addition, it allows many more stipulations to be indicated.

	With sstipulation, the play is described as a tree structure. Play 
	starts at the root, continues through branches that may fork,
	and ends in one or more leaves. After the keyword sstipulation, 
	indicate the root by specifying the side to move, then the branches
	and the leaves in the language as specified below.


	Root
	----

	The side to move is indicated; either white or black.


	Leaves
	------

	Each leaf represents 1 half move. It is indicated by a letter
	('d' or 's') that identifies its type, followed by the
	goal; the goal is indicated as in the command stipulation (see
	above). No spaces are allowed between type and goal.

	direct leaf:
	   Notation example:  d=  [direct half-move for stalemate]
	   Main purpose:      Termination of a non-self stipulation
	   Alternative:       (negated using ! (see below)) Indication of
	                      the stipulation which must not be solvable
	                      in reflex stipulations
	   Meaning:           A solution of a direct leaf is a move by the
	                      side at the move that reaches the goal.
	   Output:            all solutions

	self leaf:
	   Notation example:  s==  [forced half-move for double stalemate]
	   Main purpose:      Termination of a direct or series branch to
	                      form a (series) self stipulation
	   Meaning:           A self leaf has a solution if the side at the
	                      move has at least one legal move and if all of
	                      its legal moves reach the goal
	   Output:            If solvable: all legal moves by the side at
			      the move


	Branches
	--------

	Each branch represents a sequence of half moves that are subject
	to a specific type of play (direct, help, series). It is indicated
	by the number of half moves followed by the type of play; inside the
	indication of a branch, no spaces are allowed.

	The maximal number of half moves is normally indicated as
	single positive number, e.g. 6d (6 half-moves of direct play
	(i.e. 3 by each side)).

	Alternatively, the minimal and maximal number of half moves
	can be indicated, separated by a comma (example
	3,3h). Currently, if the minimal number is given, the two
	numbers have to be equal - the result is an exact stipulation.

	direct branch:
	   Notation example:  4d [at most 2 half moves by attacker and
	                         defender]
	   Purpose:           direct and self stipulations
	   Meaning:           The side at the move (attacker) and the other
	                      side (defender) play alternately and against
	                      each other.
	                      A solution of a direct branch is a move by the
	                      attacker that allows him to reach a position in
	                      the required number of moves (against any play
	                      by the defender) where the subsequent
	                      stipulation is solvable.
	   Right/duty of move:In the subsequent stipulation, the attacker is
	                      at the move if and only if the number of half
	                      moves is divisible by 2.
	   Output:            Key, threat (resp. Zugzwang) and all variations
	                      that are different from the threat.
	   Remark:            If the subsequent stipulation is a direct leaf,
	                      the number of half moves has to be divisible by
	                      2; if the subsequent stipulation is a self leaf,
	                      the number of half moves must not be
	                      divisible by 2 (because the attacker
	                      makes the last half move of the branch).

	help branch:
	   Notation example:  3h  [2 half moves by the side at the
				   move, with 1 half move by the other side
				   in between]
	   Purpose:           - help stipulations
	                      - penultimate half move in reflex stipulations
	   Meaning:           Both sides play alternately and collaborate. A
	                      solution of a help branch is a move sequence
	                      that leads to a position where the subsequent
	                      stipulation is solvable.
	   Right/duty of move:In the subsequent stipulation, the same side as
	                      in the help branch is at the move if and only
	                      if the number of half moves is divisible by 2.
	   Output:            all solutions

	series branch:
	   Notation example:  5ser [at most 5 half moves by the side
	                            at the move]
	   Purpose:           series stipulations
	   Meaning:           A solution is a series of half-moves by the side
			      at the move that leads to a position where the
			      subsequent stipulation is solvable.
	   Right/duty of move:In the subsequent stipulation, the side is at
	                      the move which is not at the move in the series
	                      branch.
	   Output:            all solutions


	Connections
	-----------

	Connections combine two or modify one partial
	stipulation. They are indicated using symbols; between the
	symbols and the partial stipulations, spaces are allowed.

	Sequence:	      (no symbol; optional spaces to separate)
	   Notation examples: 2dd#  [equivalent to stipulation #2]
	                      3h d# [equivalent to stipulation h#2]
	   Purpose:           Indication of the subsequent stipulation
	   Meaning:           The second partial stipulation is the
	                      subsequent stipulation of the first partial
	                      stipulation.

	Negation:             (symbol !)
	   Notation example:  !d==  ["no double-stalemate in 0.5"]
	   Purpose:           Negation of the subsequent stipulation
	   Meaning:           The negation of a stipulation is solvable if
	                      the negated stipulation isn't solvable.
	   Output:            None
	   Remark:            Typically used in reflex stipulations (the
	                      attacker must not have a solution for the
	                      subsequent stipulation).

	Boolean AND:          (symbol &)
	   Notation example:  1h d# & d#  [end of a reci-h#]
	   Purpose:           Connection of partial stipulations that both
	                      have to be solvable.
	   Output:            Solutions of the partial stipulations
	   Remarks:           Typical usages:
	                      - reciprocal helpmate (see notation example)
	                      - reflex stipulations (attacker must have a
	                        solution for one partial stipulation AND not
	                        for the other)
	                      To optimise solving time, indicate the more
	                      complex partial stipulation before the & and
	                      the simpler one after the &.

	Boolean OR:           (symbol |)
	   Notation example:  2d d# | 3d s=  [#2 OR s=2]
	   Purpose:           Connection of two partial stipulations of which
	                      at least 1 has to be solvable.
	   Output:            Solutions of the partial stipulations
	   Remark:            Typical usage: quodlibet

	Parentheses:          (symbol ())
	   Notation example:  2d ( 1h d# & !d# )  [equiv. to stipulation r#2]
	   Purpose:           Grouping of partial stipulations for indicating
	                      the order of evaluation
	   Output:            same as for partial stipulation
	   Remark:            Without parentheses, connections are evaluated
	                      left to right.

	Move inversion:       (symbol -)
	   Notation example:  5ser -d#  [equivalent to stipulation ser-#6]
	   Purpose:           Change of the side at the move
	   Output:            same as for partial stipulation


	Examples:
	---------
	#3                    white 4d d#
	s#2                   white 3d d#
	r#2                   white 2d ( 1h d# & !d# )
	semi-r#2              white 3d d#

 - forsyth: With this command you can enter the position in forsyth notation.

All these commands up to now are very easy to use (except maybe
sstipulation). A little bit more elaborate is the command

 - pieces: This command specifies all the pieces belonging to the problem.
	After this keyword, the color of the following pieces must be given:
	This is one of:

	White
	Black
	Neutral

	After the color specification 

	Chameleon
	Jigger
	Kamikaze
	Paralysing
	Royal
	Volage
	Functionary
	HalfNeutral
	HurdleColourChanging          (only for hoppers !)
	Protean
	Magic
	Uncapturable

	may be given. All the pieces given after this will have these
	attributes.  After this specification follows the list of
	pieces: First the type of the piece followed by the list of
	squares the piece should be placed on. By giving a new color
	specifiation pieces of another color may be entered without
	repeating the pieces command. Popeye knows the following
	piece types:

 - Twin: Solving/testing of positions obtained by small changes of the
	initial position. The following specifications are supported:
    Stipulation ...: The stipulation is changed. See the repective basic
	command.
    Condition ...: Cange of fairy conditions. The old conditions are
	subsituted by those put in.
    Move <square1> <square2>: Move the piece from square1 to square2. A
	piece accidentally standing on square2 will be removed. Example:
	twin move a3 b4.
    Exchange <square1> <square2>: The pieces on <square1> and <square2>
	exchange places. Example: twin exchange a3 b4.
    Remove <square>: The piece located on the square specified is removed.
	Example: twin remove e5.
    Substitute <piece1> <piece2>: All pieces of type <piece1> are replaced
	by pieces of type <piece2>. Colour and further piece specifications
	(like paralysing etc.) are not affected. Example: twin
	substitute R B.  All rooks are replaced by bishops.
    Add <colour> <piecespecs> <type><squarelist>: Add pieces. Example:
	twin add black para NHa6 - a black paralysing NightriderHopper is
	added on a6. See the basic command "pieces".
    Rotate n: Turns the board by n degrees to the left (n=90, 180, 270).
	Example: twin rotate 180.
    Mirror a1<-->h1: Mirrors the position on the vertical middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->a8: Mirrors the position on the horizontal middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->h8: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a8-h1.
    Mirror h1<-->a8: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a1-h8.
	So, not the mirror line is given, but square into which a1 (or h1)
	is turned into.
    Shift <square1> <square2>: Shift the whole position into the direction
	determined by the two squares entered. Example: twin shift a1 a2 -
	all pieces are moved one square up.
    PolishType: All pieces change colour.
	More than one change may be specified, for example twin rem e7
	add white qe8. As you can see the twinning commands can abreviated.
	By default the changes refer to the position initially set.
	Alternatively the changes can be applied to the position solved most
	recently. Just enter "continued" (or "cont") immediately after
	"twin". Example twin cont rem a1.

 - ZeroPosition: This command can be used alternatively to the command
	"twin". It indicates that the initial position is not for solving.
	The command must be followed by the changes for the first position
	to be solved. Example: zero move b4 d5
			       twin move c5 b5.

When all data have been entered to describe completely the problem,
the solving may be started by giving the keyword `endproblem' to
popeye.
Immediately after reading this, provided no input errors were discovered,
popeye starts to solve the problem.

Here comes a sample:

BeginProblem
Author          Unknown
Origin          Also Unkown
Stipulation     #2
Pieces          White   Ka3 Ra8
		Black   Kb1
Option          MoveNumbers Try Set Variation
EndProblem


This input seems long and cumbersome. But Popeye recognizes the keywords
as long as the shortage is unique. The above input may also be written
like this:


Begi
Auth    Unknown
Orig    Also Unkown
Stie    #2
Piec    Whit Ka3 Ra8
	Blac Kb1
Opti    Move Try Set Vari
Endp

In the future the minimum length of unique shortages changes, when popeyes
capabilities are increased. But we try to keep all keywords uniq within the
first four characters. If they are now uniq with less than four, its not
guaranteed for the future.

If there are more problems to be solved in one run, you can replace the
`EndProblem' directive with `NextProblem'. After this, popeye expects
an new problem specification, after he has solved the previous one.
The last problem specification should be finished with `EndProblem'.
