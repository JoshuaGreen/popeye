Some remarks on the distribution of popeye:

Popeye is free software. It means that everybody may get the source of
popeye.  We believe that this software should be public und constitutes not our
own personal property - even we have invested a lot of work. This work cannot
be waged by money, and also we devote our time to popeye not to earn money.
Therefore we distribute popeye for refunding our costs of material and shipping.
It means, if someone gets a floppy from us, he should return a floppy.
Its also possible to send us stamped return envelope with a floppy, we return 
the floppy with popeye on it. We do not mind if someone redistributes popeye.
The only thing we want to obeye is, that he distributes it as he gets it - 
meaning all the files listed below.

Starting popeye:

Change the name of your preferred executable to py.exe
To operate it from the terminal:                py
To solve problems recorded in file XX:          py XX
				   or:          py < XX

Commandline parameters:
-maxmem
	You can provide for Popeye for example 40960 kilobyte (or 40 megabye)
	of memory with
		py -maxmem 40960 XX    or   py -maxmem 40M XX
	to make calculation of problems faster.

Stopping Popeye:

        press  CTRL + C  key combination



Description of the input language of popeye:

The input to popeye is not case sensitive. Every input to popeye starts with
the reserved word `BeginProblem'. After entering this command to popeye,
following commands may be used:

	remark, author, origin, title, protocol,
        condition, option, stipulation, forsyth, pieces, twin

The order of these commands is free, and can also occur more times.
The last of the commands in the second line is relevant. All of these
commands expect further parameters. Lets start with the simpler commands:

 - remark: this keyword introduces a comment. Everything up to the end of the
	line will be ignored and has no further effects.

 - author: The parameter to this command is the author of the problem. All
	Text up to end of line will be put above the diagram in the output.
	This input is completely optional and has no effect to the other
	capabilities of the program. All the input of multiple author
	commands will be placed on the output.

 - origin: All the same as the author command.
 - title:  All the same as the author command.

 - protocol: The parameter to his command is interpreted as filename, and all
	further output of popeye on the screen is also placed in the given
	file. If the file exists already, the output of popeye is appended to
	the file. The file will not be deleted.

 - condition: All the conditions neccessary for the problem, seperated by
	blanks or newline, should be given to this command. 
        Through combination of single conditions you can get other
        already existing conditions:
        for example: Circe  and  Immunchess  results in  StrictCirce

	After the conditions Imitator, MagicField, Hole, FrischaufCirce,
	WhitePromSquares, BlackPromSquares
	or one of the ForcedSquares, list the fields on which the imitators 
	are to be placed, where the special fields are located, where 
	promoted pieces (FrischaufCirce) are located, or where the
	white or black promotionsquares are located. 
	The condition  PromOnly   must be followed by a list of pieces, separated 
	through blanks. Promotion is only allowed for those pieces.
	The list should be given in the same way as with the command pieces.
	The condition ChameleonCirce can be followed by a list of pieces,
	separated by blanks. The list determines how the pieces change before
	rebirth. (Examples: "ChameleonCirce S B R Q S" is ordinary Chameleon-
	Circe and equivalent to "ChameleonCirce", "ChameleonCirce S Q R B S"
	gives reverse ChameleonCirce.)
	After some of the Circe, Immun, Madrasi or Phantomchess conditions
        you can enter RexInclusive.
	After all Anticirce conditions "Cheylan" or "Calvet" can be entered -
	according to the type desired.
	After the Isardam condition "TypeB" can be entered.
	After the SingleBox condition "Type1", "Type2" or "Type3" can be entered.
	After the Sentinelles condition "PionAdvers", "PionNeutre", "ParaSentinelles",
              or Berolina can be entered, and also WhiteMaximum, BlackMaximum 
              or TotalMaximum followed by a number.
	After MessignyChess, (Bi)Woozles and (Bi)Heffalumps you can enter
        RexExclusive.
	After the WhiteOscillatingKings or BlackOscillatingKings condition "TypeB" or
	      or "TypeC" can be entered.

 - option: Everything which should be in effect should be given here as
	blank seperated list. The following is recognized:

	Try             calculate if a move is a try.
	Defence         this option is followed by a number indicating the number 
			of defences which should be taken into consideration. 
			For instance  Defence 1  all real tries are calculated.
	SetPlay         calculate setplay.
	Threat          for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when there is no threat in less or equal this
			number of moves.
	WhiteToPlay     white starts moving in helpplay.
	Variation       show threats and variations.
	MoveNumbers     Movenumber, already calculated move and cumulated
			solving time on output.
	StartMoveNumber This option is followed by the Movenumber
			popeye was interrupted at.
	NoWk            without white king
	NoBk            without black king
	Duplex          calculate stipulation for both sides
	NoThreat        calculate variations without calculating threats
	MaxSolutions    This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of solutions 
			are reached.
	MaxFlightsquares  for moremovers: This option must be followed
			by an integer. The opposit party has defended
			when the number of flightsquares for it's king
			are more or equal this number.
	EnPassant       Must be followed by at most two fields. A possible
			enpassant-key to this field(s) is calculated.
	NoBoard         The chessboard is not printed to screen or into file.
	NoShortVariations  Short variations are suppressed on output.
	HalfDuplex      calculate stipulation only for the opponent side.
	PostKeyPlay     The position entered is considered to be the position
			after the key. Just the solution play is analysed.
	NonTrivial m n  A special option to solve/cook/test long self and
			(semi)reflex problems. The second argument n deter-
			mines which black moves are considered to be trivial -
			a move that can be met by a s#n (or r=n resp.). In
			long problems (more than n moves) black has at every
			stage at least one nontrivial move. I. e. a move that
			doesnot lead to a s#n. The first argument m determines
			how many additional nontrivial moves can be granted to
			black by white during the whole solving procedure.
			Example: nontr 0 1. This is the most restrictive option.
			White forced to play moves that leave black with only 
			one move not met by a s#1.
	Intelligent     intelligent (quick) solving of helpmate-moremovers.
			After the intelligent option, the maximum number of 
			solutions per mating position can be given.
	MaxTime         This option must be followed by an integer. Popeye
			stops calculating if this number of seconds  
			solving time are reached.
	NoCastling	This option must be followed by the fields of those
			pieces, that cannot castle anymore in the diagram position.
	Quodlibet       In s# or r# also direct mates are a solution.
	StopOnShortSolutions  Calculation is terminated after detecting of
			      short solutions.
	Beep            This option can be followed by an integer. Each time
			Popeye has found a solution it beeps a  number  of times.  


 - stipulation: popeye knows the following stipulations:

	any useful combination of
	
						{  #= }
						{  != }
						{  00 }
						{  %  }
						{  ~  }
						{  ep }
						{  #  }
			{ SER-  }   {  H  }     {  =  }
 { m-> } + { EXACT-} +  { SEMI- } + {  S  }  +  {  == }   +   n
			{ RECI- }   {  R  }     {  +  }
						{ Zxy }
						{  x  }
						{  ## }
						{ ##! }
						{  ct }
						{  <> }
						{ ctr }
						{ <>r }

						{ dia }   +  n{.5}
			{ SER- }             +  { dia }   +  n
						{ a=>b }  +  n{.5}
			{ SER-}              +  { a=>b }  +  n

	(m, n are the number of moves)

	for example:

	#3              mate in three moves
	HZg74           help-targetfield-g7 in 4 moves
	S+2             self-check in 2 moves
	R==3            reflex-doublestalemate in 3 moves
	HS#3            helpselfmate in 3 moves         (= help forced selfmate)

	SER-%4          series-Win_a_Piece in 4 moves
	H##!4           help-"gegenmatt" in 4 moves
	SER-H##3        series-help-"beidmatt" in 3 moves
	2->ser-h#4      white makes 2 moves, then ser-h#4
	h003            help-castling in 3 moves
	dia6.5          Shortest Proofgame in 13 halfmoves
					(after the seventh move of white)
	ser-dia9        Series-Proofgame in 9 moves
	reci-h(=)#4     helpalternative(stale)mate in 4 moves
	ser-!=7         Series-AutoStalemate in 7 moves
	ser-ct10        Series-direct circuit (switchback) in 10 moves
			(of W piece)
	h<>3            help exchange place in 3 moves
			(Bl helps W swap 2 pieces from diagram)
	ser-sctr2       series self circuit by rebirth in 2 moves
			(W forces Bl to complete switchback of a W piece)
	ser-h<>r5       series help exchange place by rebirth in 5 moves
			(Bl helps W complete by rebirth the exchange 
			 of two Bl pieces)
	#=2             mate or stalemate in 2 moves
	h~1             any helpmove

	SEMI is valid only in combination with direct reflex-play.

   All these stipulations must be followed by a number giving the
   count of moves.

 - forsyth: With this command you can enter the position in forsyth notation.

All these commands up to now are very easy to use. A little bit more
elaborate is the command

 - pieces: This command specifies all the pieces belonging to the problem.
	After this keyword, the color of the following pieces must be given:
	This is one of:

	White
	Black
	Neutral

	After the color specification 

	Chameleon
	Jigger
	Kamikaze
	Paralysing
	Royal
	Volage
	Functionary
	HalfNeutral
	HurdleColourChanging          (only for hoppers !)

	may be given. All the pieces given after this will have these attributes.
	After this specification follows the list of pieces: First the name
	of the piece followed by the list of fields the piece should be
	placed on. By giving a new color specifiation pieces of another color
	may be entered without repeating the pieces command. Popeye knows the
	following pieces:

	15      1,5-leaper
	16      1,6-leaper
	24      2,4-leaper

    Substitute <piece1> <piece2>: All pieces of type 1 are replaced by
	pieces of type 2. Colour and further piece specification (like
	paralysing etc.) are not effected. Example: twin substitute R B.
	All rooks are replaced by bishops.
    Add <colour> <piecespecs> <type><fieldlist>: Adding pieces. Example:
	twin add black para NHa6 - a black paralysing NightriderHopper is
	added on a6. See the basic command "pieces".
    Rotate n: Turns the board by n degrees to the left (n=90, 180, 270).
	Example: twin rotate 180.
    Mirror a1<-->h1: Mirrors the position on the vertical middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->a8: Mirrors the position on the horizontal middle line.
    Mirror a1<-->h8: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a8-h1.
    Mirror h1<-->a8: Mirrors the position on the diagonal a1-h8.
	So, not the mirror line is given, but square into which a1 (or h1)
	is turned into.
    Shift <square1> <square2>: Shift the whole position into the direction
	determined by the two squares entered. Example: twin shift a1 a2 -
	all pieces are moved one square up.
    PolishType: All pieces change colour.
	More than one change may be specified, for example twin rem e7
	add white qe8. As you can see the twinning commands can abreviated.
	By default the changes refer to the position initially set.
	Alternatively the changes can be applied to the position solved most
	recently. Just enter "continued" (or "cont") immediately after
	"twin". Example twin cont rem a1.

 - ZeroPosition: This command can be used alternatively to the command
	"twin". It indicates that the initial position is not for solving.
	The command must be followed by the changes for the first position
	to be solved. Example: zero move b4 d5
			       twin move c5 b5.

When all data have been entered to describe completely the problem, the solving
may be started by giving the keyword `endproblem' to popeye.
Immediately after reading this, provided no input errors were discovered,
popeye starts to solve the problem.

Here comes a sample:

BeginProblem
Author          Unknown
Origin          Also Unkown
Stipulation     #2
Pieces          White   Ka3 Ra8
		Black   Kb1
Option          MoveNumbers Try Set Variation
EndProblem


This input seems long and cumbersome. But Popeye recognizes the keywords
as long as the shortage is unique. The above input may also be written
like this:


Begi
Auth    Unknown
Orig    Also Unkown
Stie    #2
Piec    Whit Ka3 Ra8
	Blac Kb1
Opti    Move Try Set Vari
Endp

In the future the minimum length of unique shortages changes, when popeyes
capabilities are increased. But we try to keep all keywords uniq within the
first four characters. If they are now uniq with less than four, its not
guaranteed for the future.

If there are more problems to be solved in one run, you can replace the
`EndProblem' directive with `NextProblem'. After this, popeye expects
an new problem specification, after he has solved the previous one.
The last problem specification should be finished with `EndProblem'.
