# -*- Makefile -*-
#

# Include file for makefile.unx for compiling on a Unix-ish platform
# (including MacOS X) for that same platform using the Gnu Compiler
# collection's C compiler.
# I.e. host platform is equal to target platform.

# Requirements:
#
# The following tools can be used to produce executables for the host
# and target plarform and can be found in the $PATH
# - gcc
# - ar
# - ranlib
# - strip


# Compiler selection
# ==================

# Compiler for creating executables on host
CCHOST=gcc

# Linker for creating executables on host
LDHOST=gcc

# Compiler for creating executables on target
CCTARGET=gcc

# Linker for creating executables on target
LDTARGET=gcc

# Strip utility to remove unnecessary symbols from executable
STRIPTARGET=strip


# Librarian
# ---------

# A library is called archive on Unix-ish platforms

# Archive generator
ARCHIVER = ar rv

# Archive index generator
ARCHIVE_INDEXER = ranlib


# Compiler options
# ================

# Select warning level
WARN=-W -Wall -pedantic -Wno-unused-parameter

# Select whether to produce an executable with debugging and profiling

# Indicate target architecture to compiler
#ARCH=-m64		# force 64 bit environment
#ARCH=-m32              # force 32 bit environment
ARCH=                   # use platform default

# Select target compiler optimization level

# Platform spedific file name suffixes
# ====================================

# suffix for objects

# suffix for libraries

# Selector for platform-specific files
# ====================================
